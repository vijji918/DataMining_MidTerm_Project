Introduction
This document describes how to use and run the python script for generating association rules using Brute-Force, Apriori and FP-Growth and also compare their performance.

Tools and Libraries:
To execute the program we need following libraries:
mlxtend
pandas
numpy
itertools

Set-up:
Clone the github repository from link : https://github.com/vijji918/DataMining_MidTerm_Project/tree/main
Go to project directory
Install python libraries by executing pip install -r requirements.txt
Run command “python .\mid_term_project.py” to start the program

Data:
For testing the implementation I have created 5 datasets with 20 transactions and 10 unique items.
